FlipFeeds: Business & Viral Growth Strategy1. Core Philosophy: "The Intentional Flip"Our business and growth strategy stems directly from our product philosophy.Traditional Social: "Find everyone you know, follow everyone you find." This is a pull model that creates noisy, algorithmic feeds.FlipFeeds: "Start with one trusted Circle." This is an invite model. A user's experience is intentionally empty until a trusted source "flips" their feed by inviting them.Our growth is not based on "friending" but on "sharing."2. Phase 1: The "Yo" Strategy - Viral AcquisitionThe goal is to replicate the "Yo" app's frictionless, novel, and slightly-silly-but-compelling growth loop.The Mechanic: The "Flip Link" (or QR Code).The Loop:User A installs FlipFeeds. They are prompted to create their first private Circle (e.g., "Best Friends," "Family Chat").The app immediately and prominently presents them with a "Flip Your Friends' Feed" button.This generates a unique, single-use, or time-limited "Flip Link."User A shares this link via text, WhatsApp, etc. The message is simple: "Flipping your feed. Tap this to see my videos."User B (on mobile) taps the link.If they don't have the app, it goes to the App Store/Play Store.After install, the app deep-links them directly into User A's private Circle.User B's app experience is instantly populated. Their feed is no longer empty; it has been "flipped" by User A.Why this is like "Yo":Simplicity: The entire onboarding flow for a new user (User B) is one tap. They don't need to search for User A, send a friend request, and wait.Novelty: The concept of "flipping" someone's feed is a powerful, tangible action. It's not a "poke" or a "friend request"; it's an act of content-sharing.Intimacy: It starts with a 1-to-1 or 1-to-few relationship, which is the stickiest kind. We are not asking users to join a 10,000-person public server first.3. Phase 2: Building Stickiness - The AI "Magic"The viral loop gets users in the door. The AI-first features make them stay.Initial "Wow": Within 10 minutes of joining, User B sees User A's videos with AI-generated summaries. When they upload their first video, we offer to "Write a title for me." This is the immediate, tangible value.The Content-to-Community Bridge: FlipFeeds is not a group chat. It's a media feed for your group. The AI tools (summaries, search) are what differentiate this from just a WhatsApp group.Introducing Discovery: After a user has joined 2-3 (private) Circles, we introduce the "Discovery" tab. This is where they can find public Feeds. This is a crucial, phased onboarding. We first establish trust, then we introduce public content.4. Phase 3: Monetization & ExtensibilityThis is how we become a sustainable platform, not just a viral hit. Our model is Multi-Tenant SaaS (Circles-as-a-Service).The Business ModelFree Tier (The "User"):Join unlimited Circles.Create up to 3 Circles (private or public).Circle member limit of 50.Basic AI features (e.g., 10 video summaries/mo).Basic AI moderation for public Feeds.Pro Tier (The "Creator" / "Tenant"): ($5-$10/mo)Create unlimited Circles.Increased member limit (e.g., 500 members).Advanced AI moderation tools.High-volume AI quotas (summaries, title generation).Custom branding for their Circle.Access to the "Feed Apps" (Genkit) Platform.The "Feed Apps" Platform (Our "Discord Bots")This is how we allow extensibility without letting abuse run rampant.The Concept: Feed Owners (Pro Tier) can link their own Genkit flows to their Circle, creating "Feed Apps."The Mechanism (Backend):A Pro Feed Owner gets an "Apps" tab in their Circle settings.They can "Register a New App."They provide:App Name: (e.g., "My Summary Bot").Trigger Command: (e.g., /summarize).Your MCP Server Endpoint URL: (e.g., https://my-genkit-server.com/summarizeVideo).A Secret/API Key: This is for our backend to authenticate with their backend.The User Flow:A member in that Circle posts a video and adds the comment: /summarize.FlipFeeds' backend sees the /summarize trigger for that Circle.Our MCP server calls the registered https://my-genkit-server.com/summarizeVideo endpoint, passing the video data and the secret.The Feed Owner's custom Genkit flow runs.Their flow returns a text string (the summary).Our backend posts that string as a reply from "My Summary Bot."5. How We Prevent Abuse (The Defensibility)This is the most critical part. We must be proactive and architectural in our-abuse prevention.Problem 1: User/Spam AbuseSolution: Mandatory Phone Number Verification on signup. This is non-negotiable for a social app. It's the single most effective way to stop mass bot-net creation.Problem 2: Malicious Content (CSAM, Hate Speech)Solution: AI-First Moderation (Our Genkit Flows).All public content (posts in public Feeds, public profile pictures) is required to pass through our moderateVideoPrompt / moderateImagePrompt Genkit flows before it's visible.All private content is still scanned for CSAM hashes (a legal requirement).Global Banhammer: A user banned for critical violations is banned at the Auth level. Their phone number is blacklisted.Problem 3: Extensibility Abuse (Malicious "Feed Apps")This is the new, big-risk vector.Solution 1: It's a Paid Feature. By putting "Feed Apps" behind the Pro Tier, we tie it to a credit card. This massively reduces drive-by abuse.Solution 2: Sandbox All Responses. The output of a custom Circle App (the text, the image, the video) is still run through our own moderate... Genkit flows before it is posted to the Circle. If a user's custom bot tries to post hate speech, our system blocks the post and flags the Feed Owner.Solution 3: Strict API Scopes. A Circle App API only receives data about the specific event it was triggered by (e.g., "this new post," "this message"). It never gets access to the Circle's member list, user emails, or any data outside of its immediate context. This prevents data-scraping bots.Solution 4: Rate Limiting. All custom app endpoints are heavily rate-limited to prevent DDoS or spam.
