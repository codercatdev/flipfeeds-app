FlipFeeds: Project Philosophy & Differentiators1. Core Concept: "Flipping Your Feed"The name "FlipFeeds" is the core marketing and product message.Problem: Modern social media is a "passive" experience. Algorithmic feeds (Facebook, Twitter, TikTok) push content to you, often leading to doom-scrolling, misinformation, and a "bad taste" as you mentioned. Discord is "active" but is a chat-first tool, not a media-first one.Solution: FlipFeeds is an "intentional" experience. A user's main feed is empty by default. To get content, they must intentionally join a "Feed." This action is "flipping your feed" from the void to a curated stream of content you explicitly asked for.Inspiration: This is the core lesson from Google+. "Feed" were a brilliant way to manage who you share with. We are flipping this: Feed are about what you consume.2. Our DifferentiatorsThis is how we stand apart from the giants:Feature/ConceptFacebook / InstagramTwitter (X)RedditDiscordFlipFeeds (Our Edge)Primary FeedAlgorithmic (Friends + Ads + Suggested)Algorithmic (Following + Ads + Suggested)Algorithmic (Subreddits + Ads + Suggested)N/A (Chat-first)Intentional (Feed-Only). Your feed is only content from Feed you join. No algorithmic "For You" page unless you enter Discovery mode.Core UnitThe "Friend" / "Follower"The "Follower"The "Subreddit"The "Server"The "Feed". A Feed is a content stream and a community.Primary ModalityImage / Text / Short VideoTextText / Links / ImagesText / Voice ChatVideo-First. The primary post type is video. All other types (text, images) are secondary.AI IntegrationBackend (Ads, Ranking)Backend (Ranking)Backend (Moderation)Add-on (Bots)AI-First (Genkit). AI is a creative tool for users (video summaries, title generation, content creation) and a core part of the experience, not just a hidden ranking engine.DiscoverabilitySuggests "People You May Know"Suggests "Who to Follow"r/all, searchServer DiscoveryDiscovery Mode. An optional mode where users can browse public Feed. Private Feed are unlisted and invite-only.MonetizationIntrusive AdsIntrusive Ads / SubscriptionAds / Subscription (Gold)Subscription (Nitro)Multi-Tenant SaaS. Feed are the "tenants." Feed owners can potentially charge for access (future), and we charge owners for premium features (AI tokens, storage, etc.). This aligns our incentives with creators, not advertisers.Data ModelThe "Social Graph"The "Interest Graph"The "Community Graph"The "Chat Server"The "Feed Graph". A user's identity is defined by the set of Feed they belong to.3. The "AI-First" Promise (via Genkit)Our biggest technical differentiator is making AI a tangible tool for every user.For Users:AI Video Summaries: Auto-generated summaries for all videos.AI Title/Description: Genkit suggests catchy titles/descriptions when uploading.AI-Powered Search: Search inside videos (e.g., "find the part where they talk about the new Firebase SDK").For Feed Admins:AI Moderation: Genkit flows to automatically flag/remove spam, hate speech, or off-topic content.AI Welcome Bots: Genkit-powered bots to welcome new members.AI Analytics: Summaries of "what was the Feed's vibe this week?"For Creators:AI Content Generation: "Suggest 5 video ideas for my 'Next.js Tips' Feed."AI-Assisted Editing: (Future) Tools to trim silence, add captions, etc.By wrapping all this in Genkit and an MCP server, we make the AI layer consistent, manageable, and testable (via Genkit Inspector).
